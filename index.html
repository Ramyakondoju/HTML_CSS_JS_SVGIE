            <dt><strong>Enjoy the power hitters at the World Cup</strong></dt>
            <dd>One of cricketâ€™s greatest sights is seeing a batsman strike the ball high, wide and handsome, sending it out of the playing ground for a six. This World Cup is set to be one in which power hitters such as Chris Gayle, Jos Buttler, Virat Kohli, David Miller and Martin Guptill come to the fore, with batsmen adopting ever more aggressive approaches in limited overs cricket.</dd>
            <dt><strong> the brilliance of world-class bowlers</strong></dt>
            <dd>The balance of the battle between bat and ball has long been a key factor in limited overs cricket. Batsmen have generally held sway in recent years, with rising run rates and smaller boundaries making life tougher for bowling attacks. However, the likes of Jofras Archer, Mitchell Starc, Kagiso Rabada, Jasprit Bumrah and Oshane Thomas are leading the light for the quicks, while spinners such as Shakib Al Hasan, Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal will use their guile and skill to dominate.</dd>
